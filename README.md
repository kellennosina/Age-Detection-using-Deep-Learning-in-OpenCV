# Age Detection using Deep Learning in OpenCV

## Overview
This project focuses on detecting and estimating a person's age from an image using deep learning techniques with OpenCV. A pre-trained deep neural network is utilized to analyze facial features and predict age categories.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of labeled facial images with corresponding age annotations. Commonly used datasets for age detection include:
- Adience Dataset
- IMDB-WIKI Dataset
- UTKFace Dataset

## Model Architecture
This project uses a deep learning model trained for age estimation, such as:
- **Caffe-based Age Detection Model**
- **Deep Learning CNN Models (VGG16, ResNet, etc.)**
- **Custom-built CNN trained on age-labeled datasets**

## Installation and Dependencies
To run this project, install the necessary dependencies:
```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy matplotlib tensorflow keras
```

## Implementation Steps
1. Load a pre-trained deep learning model for age estimation.
2. Preprocess the input image by detecting and extracting the face region.
3. Resize and normalize the image for input to the model.
4. Pass the processed image through the model for age prediction.
5. Display the estimated age on the image using OpenCV.

## Usage
- Run the age detection script:
```bash
python age_detection.py --image path/to/face_image.jpg
```

## Results
The model predicts the approximate age group of a person. Evaluation metrics include:
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Accuracy within certain age ranges

## Future Improvements
- Improve accuracy with a larger dataset
- Implement real-time age detection using webcam feed
- Enhance robustness for different lighting and angles
